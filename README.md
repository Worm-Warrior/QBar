# QBar—Local and Remote Music Player Using Qt

This music player is a personal project to make a music player that I want to use and that has the features I want.

While using Feishin, I noticed that it froze my desktop and consumed a lot of CPU resources when left open.

I decided that I should try and make my own small program to do exactly what I want out of a music player and nothing more, both because I was annoyed and because it seemed like a fun project to try and learn desktop UI in a more "serious" language like C++.

I do not know if I will add things like playlists, advanced searching/filtering, or a fancy UI.

The main goals of the music player are:

1. There should be no performance problems; it should "just work."

2. It should be simple in terms of UI and features, very barebones.

3. It should be able to play both local and remote files from Navidrome, and the switch should be as seamless as possible.
